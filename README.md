# GeoFS-Fuel
This is an experimental addon for GeoFS that attempts to simulate fuel consumption. It calculates fuel capacity based on aircraft mass and calculates burn rates based on engine RPM. You must be on the ground, groundspeed 0, and engines off to refuel. Feel free to fine-tune the burnrates and things on lines 49 and 72 (the larger the values, the longer the endurance). For line 72 you have to change both of the 140's. Happy Flying!
